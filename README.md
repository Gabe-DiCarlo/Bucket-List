## Functional Requirements

Given a current set of GPS coordinates or city/state and a keyword list, When user clicks button, search for matches within a 100 miles of that city/state or coordinates, Then display matches. Keyword list may include bucket list items or other interests.

Given a hiking trail's GPS coordinates, when the user clicks search, parse through database containing trail name and coordinates, then display the matches.

Given a set of GPS coordiantes, location name, city/state information, and description, when the user searches for a Bucket-List location, parse through the database and find all matching keywords, then display results.

Given a set of GPS coordiantes, location name, city/state information, and description results for a location, when the user clicks add, parse through the database and look for matches, then add a new entry for non existent locations.

## Class Diagram

(Show data classes (DTOs), Activities, Fragments, MVVM, etc. I use ArgoUML to model classes in a diagram.  Other tools work as well.)

## Class Diagram Description

(One or two lines for each class to describe  use of interfaces, JME classes, Dalvik (Android) classes and resources, interfaces, etc. Don't worry about putting more than a few words to each class; this does not need to be thorough.)
